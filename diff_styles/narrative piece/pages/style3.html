		<p id="1">Hundreds of thousands of protesters decrying the Catalan government's push for independence came together in Barcelona on Sunday, in one of the biggest gatherings of Spanish unity supporters.</p>

		<p>Waving flags and singing "Viva España," the marchers gave voice to what some have called the silent majority in a region whose government declared independence from Spain on Friday.</p>
	
		<p>Polls show roughly half of the Catalan electorate supports sticking with Spain, while the other half supports forming their own country.</p>

		<p>As NPR's Lauren Frayer has reported from Spain, those supporting unity have tended to be quieter than separatists because they are defending the status quo. "Support for staying in Spain had been growing in recent years, despite almost daily independence rallies in Barcelona, the Catalan capital," Lauren says.</p>

		<p>Sunday's rally capped a tumultuous weekend that saw the central government taking formal control of Catalonia on Saturday.</p>
